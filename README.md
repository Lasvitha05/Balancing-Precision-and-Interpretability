# Balancing-Precision-and-Interpretability
Balancing Precision and Interpretability : A Comparative Study of Classification Techniques for Predicting Heart Diseases

# Project Overview
This research project focuses on comparing various binary classification techniques to predict heart diseases, emphasizing the balance between model interpretability and prediction accuracy. The study aims to determine if the increased precision from complex models justifies the loss of interpretability in medical decision-making contexts.
# Key Features

Comparative analysis of multiple classification techniques
Focus on interpretability vs. precision trade-off
Utilization of diverse indicators for coronary arterial diseases
Evaluation based on training time, prediction accuracy, and model interpretability

# Models Explored

Logistic Regression
Lasso and Ridge Regression
Polynomial Regression
Generalized Additive Models (GAM)
Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)
Decision Trees and Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)

# Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including summary statistics, distribution analysis, and correlation studies
Feature importance analysis
Visualization techniques: histograms, box plots, scatter plots, violin plots

# Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC
Sensitivity vs. Specificity analysis
Cross-validation for robust model comparison

# Model Interpretation
Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)
Confusion Matrix Analysis
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) Values

# Goals
Achieve prediction accuracy greater than 95%
Provide insights into model performance and interpretability
Contribute to the dialogue on suitable predictive models in medical decision-making
